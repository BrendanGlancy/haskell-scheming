# Haskell Scheming

Haskell is a functional programming language, Functional Programming aims to write code that is clearer to understand and more bug resistant.
This is achieved by avoiding <b>flow-control</b> statements:
- for
- while
- break 
- continue
- goto 

These make the code harder to follow.

## Functional Programming requires us to:
- write pure, deterministic functions 
- which are less likely to be buggy

## Scheme interpreter

**Scheme is a minimalist dialect of the Lisp Family of programming languages**
